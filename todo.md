# TODO

Try implementing frontend using SSR + plain JS. (Make sure it is adequately setup. Can always review the book.)

- [x] Δ `Island` bounds to backend, + `:placed` key
- [ ] (Δ `server.ex` responses too)

1. Δ frontend to handle payload w/ unplaced islands
2. Δ `Board` for better re-rendering
3. + "Set Islands" button
4. - `Island` re-placement bugs

BUGS:
* `App.js`: onEnter
